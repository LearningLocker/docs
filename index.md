## About

Learning Locker is an open source Learning Record Store; a type of data repository designed to store learning activity statements generated by xAPI (Tin Can) compliant learning activities. Organisations use Learning Locker to [store, sort and share learning data](http://learninglocker.net/features/benefits/) as generated by their learners. Using this data organisations can better understand the learning activities of their workforce, assess the impact of training and development and customise learning experiences based on learners past performance.

We’re an open source community effort. To understand a little about where we are heading see our future [product roadmap](http://www.learninglocker.net/roadmap). If you want to know more about getting involved please see our [community pages](http://learninglocker.net/community/).

> Learning Locker only supports xAPI v1.0 and above. It is not suitable for platforms still using an earlier version of xAPI. At this time there are no plans to provide backwards compatibility for older versions of the spec.
