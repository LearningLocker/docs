## GET /agents
This route allows you to retrieve all of the agents that are used by a single person, given one of the agents that they use via the required `agent` URL parameter. The request below demonstrates how this is done. A person can be created by inserting statements or using the [Persona HTTP interface](../http-personas). Multiple agents can be associated with a person by using the [Persona HTTP interface](../http-personas) too. For more information, view the [GET /agents route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#24-agents-resource).

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```

The response will always be a 200 for valid requests, similar to the response below. 

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "objectType": "Person",
  "account": [],
  "mbox": ["mailto:test@example.org"],
  "mbox_sha1sum": [],
  "openid": []
}
```

## PUT /agents/profile
This route allows you to create a single profile document if it doesn't exist or overwrite an existing profile document if it does exist. The route has 2 required URL parameters, an `agent` (a JSON encoded object representing the agent that the profile belongs to) and a `profileId` (a string representing an identifier for the profile). For more information, view the [PUT /agents/profile route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#agentprofres).

### PUT Initial Profile
To PUT an initial profile, the request should be something like the request below. Notice that there is an `If-None-Match` header in the request below, this is to ensure that a profile document doesn't already exist before the profile document is created. Without the `If-None-Match` header there would be a precondition failure thrown and the response would be a 412 for the request below.

```http
PUT http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&profileId=example_profile_id
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
If-None-Match: "*"

{
  "key_to_remove": "value_to_remove",
  "key_to_change": "value_before_changed"
}
```

This route returns a 204 response with no content when the profile document is successfully created, like the example response below. The route will return 412 for a precondition failure if the profile document does already exist and the profile document will not be changed. 

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```

### GET Initial PUT Agent ETag
To retrieve the ETag for the initial profile, you need to retrieve the profile via the [GET /agents/profile route](#get-agentsprofile). The request below demonstrates how to do this.

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&profileId=example_profile_id
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```

The response to the request above would be something similar to the response below. Notice that it contains the `ETag` header.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
ETag: "7C0791125FAB08C7EB75CC8044CFDCEA56F506958DEEE763E6608608EE76C9EE"
Last-Modified: 2017-08-31T15:16:29.709Z

{
  "key_to_remove": "value_to_remove",
  "key_to_change": "value_before_changed"
}
```

### PUT Overwrite Profile
To PUT a profile for overwriting, the request should be something like the request below. Notice that the [ETag from the previous request](#get-initial-put-agent-etag) has been used in the `If-Match` header below. Without the `If-Match` header containing the correct ETag there would be a precondition failure thrown and the response would be a 412 for the request below. The `If-Match` header ensures that concurrent updates only change the existing profile document you expected to change.

```http
PUT http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&profileId=example_profile_id
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
If-Match: "7C0791125FAB08C7EB75CC8044CFDCEA56F506958DEEE763E6608608EE76C9EE"

{
  "key_to_change": "value_after_change",
  "key_to_add": "value_to_add"
}
```

The response to the request above would be something similar to the response below.

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```

### GET Overwritten Profile
To GET the overwritten profile, the request should be something like the request below.

  "key_to_change": "value_after_change",
  "key_to_add": "value_to_add"
}
```

## POST /agents/profile
This route allows you to create a single profile document if it doesn't exist or merge an existing profile document if it does exist. The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /agents/profile route](#put-agentsprofile). The profile document is merged when the profile document exists, the existing profile document is a JSON encoded object, and the posted profile document is a JSON encoded object. When the two JSON encoded documents are merged, only the top-level properties are merged. The example requests below demonstrate merging profile documents. For more information, view the [POST /agents/profile route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#agentprofres).

### POST Initial Profile
To POST an initial profile, the request should be something like the request below. Notice that there is an `If-None-Match` header in the request below, this is to ensure that a profile document doesn't already exist before the profile document is created. Without the `If-None-Match` header there would be a precondition failure thrown and the response would be a 412 for the request below.

```http
POST http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&profileId=example_profile_id

## GET /agents/profile
This route allows you to retrieve a single profile document or multiple profile identifiers. If the `profileId` URL parameter is set, it will [retrieve a single profile document](#retrieve-single-agent-document) with the profile identifier, otherwise it will [retrieve many profile identifiers](#retrieve-many-agent-identifiers). For more information, view the [GET /agents/profile route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#agentprofres).

### Retrieve Single Agent Document
The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /agents/profile route](#put-agentsprofile). A request to this route should be similar to the request below.

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&profileId=example_profile_id
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH

Last-Modified: 2017-08-31T15:16:29.709Z

{
  "example_key": "example_value"
}
```

### Retrieve Many Agent Identifiers
The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /agents/profile route](#put-agentsprofile) except for the `profileId` parameter and with the addition of the optional `since` parameter. The `since` URL parameter is an ISO timestamp that ensures only profile identifiers stored since the timestamp (exclusive) are returned. A request to this route should be similar to the request below.

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/agents/profile?agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&since=2017-09-04T12:45:31+00:00
