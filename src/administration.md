# Administration

## Setup
Once you've logged in, click on the settings option (left hand navigation). Clicking "Edit settings" (top right) will let you edit each setting.

*  **Name:** the global name for your instance. e.g. HT2 Staff LRS
*  **Description:** a short description
*  **Site email:** the main administration email address
*  **Language:** the default language for your instance (not yet wired up)
*  **Who can create a new LRS:** which type of user can create new LRSs. See [Instance Users](#instance-users) for details on the different user types.
*  **Registration:** "open" or "closed"? If this is set to "closed" then any users will need to be invited in.
*  **Restrict registration:** if you decide to have "open" registration, you can restrict registration to a particular email domain e.g. ht2.co.uk

## Instance Users

A Learning Locker instance has three types of Users (described below).

*  **Super**: control all aspects of the instance (such as accessing, creating, and deleting LRSs and users).
*  **Observer plus**
*  **Observer**

The reason we have observer and observer plus is solely to provide an option to grant creating LRSs to a certain group of individuals. See "Who can create new LRSs?" in [#setup](#setup).

## LRS Users

An instance of Learning Locker lets you create as many LRSs as you need. Each LRS is private to the person who created it and anyone they invite in.
