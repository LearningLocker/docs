# Migrating from V1 Guide
Before migrating from version 1, you will need to [install the current version](../guides-installing) with a blank database.

Once you have the current version successfully installed and working, you may follow the instructions at [use the migration tool](https://github.com/LearningLocker/v1-to-v2-migrator) which will download your version 1 database, migrate your data to the current version, and upload the migrated data into your current version's database.

Note that the migration tool will also copy your xAPI documents and attachments, but currently we only provide support for moving files from and to local storage and s3 storage.
