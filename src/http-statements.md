# Statements HTTP Interface

Statements hold all of the xAPI records that have been inserted into the database via the [xAPI Statements HTTP interface](../http-xapi-statements).

It is accessible through the following HTTP interfaces:

- [Connection HTTP Interface](../http-connection) via http://www.example.org/api/connection/statement.
- [REST HTTP Interface](../http-rest) via http://www.example.org/api/v2/statement.

Whilst statements _can_ be inserted via the Models HTTP interface, this is not recommended as it bypasses all validation, reference and void checking, leading to invalid xAPI records.

Statements can be deleted by the REST API. See [Statement Deletion API](../http-statement-deletion) for more information.

Optional metadata can be added to a statement via the [Metadata API](../http-metadata). 
We automatically add metadata in cases such as for [question statements](../guides-assessment-statements) (typically coming from Adapt), which makes reporting on assessments much easier than previously possible.
