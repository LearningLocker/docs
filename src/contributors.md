## Project Sponsor

Initially the Learning Locker project has been sponsored by HT2, a for-profit learning technology developer. Learning Locker will always be free to download, install and run for everyone. To compliment this, HT2 offers services such as hosting, support and consultancy in a commercial capacity. In addition, HT2 holds copyright over certain Learning Locker trademarks, including the name ‘Learning Locker’ and the squirrel logo. This ownership is necessary to prevent 3rd parties ‘passing off’ Learning Locker as their own work, instead of the community effort it really is.
