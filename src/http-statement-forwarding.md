### *[Enterprise]*: Forwarding to AWS Kinesis
_Note: Only available in Enterprise editions of Learning Locker_

To create a statement forward configured for AWS Kinesis Firehose, configure the record with this modified data structure:

```js
  "configuration" : {
    "protocol" : "Kinesis",
    "authType" : "no auth"
  },
  "kinesisOptions" : {
    "streamName" : "KinesisFirehoseName", // The immutable name of the Kinesis Firehose configured in AWS
    "awsClientKey" : "xxxxxxxxxxxx", // AWS client access key with appropriate permission
    "awsClientSecret" : "xxxxxxxxxxxx", // AWS client secret key
    "awsRegion" : "us-east-1" // AWS Kinesis Firehose region
  },
```

#### Permissions
In order for Learning Locker to successfully write to the Kinesis Firehose, please ensure that the IAM user (attributed to the key/secret) has the minimum permissions in its policy (as shown below). When using the example below, please replace `region`, `account-id`, and `KinesisFirehoseName` with your details in the `Resource` array.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "firehose:PutRecord",
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/KinesisFirehoseName"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
