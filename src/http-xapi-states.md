## PUT /activities/state
This route allows you to create a single state document if it doesn't exist or overwrite an existing state document if it does exist. The route has 3 required URL parameters, an `activityId` (an IRI representing the activity), an `agent` (a JSON encoded object representing the agent the state belongs to), and a `stateId` (a string representing an identifier for the state). There is also an optional URL parameter for the `registration`. A request to this route would look something like the request below.

```http
PUT http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/activities/state?activityId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Factivity&agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&stateId=example_state_id&registration=361cd8ef-0f6a-40d2-81f2-b988865f640c
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "example_key": "example_value"
}
```

This route returns a 204 response with no content when the state document is successfully created/overwritten, like the example response below.

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```

For more information, view the [PUT /activities/state route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#single-document-put--post--get--delete).

## POST /activities/state
This route allows you to create a single state document if it doesn't exist or merge an existing state document if it does exist. The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /activities/state route](#put-activitiesstate). The state document is merged when the state document exists, the existing state document is a JSON encoded object, and the posted state document is a JSON encoded object. When the two JSON encoded documents are merged, only the top-level properties are merged. The example requests below demonstrate merging state documents. For more information, view the [POST /activities/state route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#single-document-put--post--get--delete).

### POST Initial State
To POST an initial state, the request should be something like the request below.

```http

}
```

## GET /activities/state
This route allows you to retrieve a single state document or multiple state identifiers. If the `stateId` URL parameter is set, it will [retrieve a single state document](#retrieve-single-state-document) with the state identifier, otherwise it will [retrieve many state identifiers](#retrieve-many-state-identifiers). For more information, view the [GET /activities/state route in the xAPI specification](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#single-document-put--post--get--delete).

### Retrieve Single State Document
The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /activities/state route](#put-activitiesstate). A request to this route should be similar to the request below.

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/activities/state?activityId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Factivity&agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&stateId=example_state_id&registration=361cd8ef-0f6a-40d2-81f2-b988865f640c

}
```

### Retrieve Many State Identifiers
The route allows the same URL parameters as the [PUT /activities/state route](#put-activitiesstate) except for the `stateId` parameter and with the addition of the optional `since` parameter. The `since` URL parameter is an ISO timestamp that ensures only state identifiers stored since the timestamp (exclusive) are returned. A request to this route should be similar to the request below.

```http
GET http://www.example.org/data/xAPI/activities/state?activityId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.org%2Factivity&agent=%7B%22mbox%22%3A%20%22mailto%3Atest%40example.org%22%7D&registration=361cd8ef-0f6a-40d2-81f2-b988865f640c&since=2017-09-04T12:45:31+00:00
Authorization: YOUR_BASIC_AUTH
X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
```
