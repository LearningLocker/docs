# xAPI HTTP Interface
Learning Locker's HTTP interface conforms to the xAPI specification. The xAPI defines how to track learning experiences for analysis and serves as a guide to maximise interoperability between services that provide learning experiences.

The table below describes the routes that the HTTP interface provides, all of the URLs are relative to http://www.example.org/data/xAPI where http://www.example.org is the URL of your Learning Locker instance. To access this interface, you must additionally supply your Basic Auth details with each request in the `Authorization` header. Your Basic Auth details can be found under **Settings** > **Clients**.
